```lrc
[00:09.19] I'm lost in your world
[00:13.20] Looking for a purpose that belongs to me only
[00:22.93] May the lilies bloom for me
[00:36.43] 
[00:31.57] Do you hear the lilies speak?
[00:36.57] The leaves kissing the bees
[00:40.66] The soil covering up all the sorrow
[00:46.11] All the seeds I sowed
[00:49.34] In a garden can't be claimed by me
[00:55.02] Do you hear the lilies speak?
[01:09.52] 
[01:02.57] I gave it my all
[01:05.41] Isn't it supposed to be sunny now?
[01:09.65] But my rain won't stop
[01:12.68] My rain won't stop
[01:21.68] 
[01:15.53] The hell I saw, voices I heard
[01:19.59] The dreams that I lost changed nothing at all
[01:24.45] I'm still my insufferable self
[01:27.16] Setting my hair on fire
[01:29.81] Giving you warmth
[01:31.38] Hoping you'd rеalize I want you by my side
[01:38.97] May the liliеs bloom for me
[01:52.47] 
[01:45.49] Thought I would be satisfied
[01:50.41] Seeing you content at the other side
[01:56.00] But somehow I thought these crazy thoughts
[02:00.72] That I deserve to be loved
[02:03.99] I deserve to know love
[02:06.76] We deserve to live in love
[02:09.72] I wish there's no end
[02:12.93] I wish there's no end to our time together
[02:33.93] 
[02:19.16] The lilies wilted
[02:22.91] Waving down into my coffin
[02:25.91] Goodbye, my youth expensed
[02:29.14] Goodbye, my innocence
[02:31.60] Should I be mad? Should I be glad?
[02:34.45] Am I enough?
[02:40.45] 
[02:36.12] How can I be enough so I'm proud of myself?
[02:41.87] Reaching my goals
[02:43.12] Distracting my feelings changed nothing at all
[02:47.83] I'm still my insatiable self
[02:50.52] Isn't it better to be dumb?
[02:53.53] To be ignorant? Not knowing there is liberty
[02:58.21] In this world not meant for me
[03:02.54] May the lilies bloom for me
